## Transparent parallelisation

We believe that users should be able to decide *if* and *how* the functions
provided in this package should run in parallel.

This is made easy by the [future framework](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) 
([introduction video](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/future-simple-async-parallel-amp-distributed-processing-in-r-whats-next-henrik-bengtsson)).

Similarly, the option to add a progress bar is left to the user by relying on 
the [progressr package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=progressr).
